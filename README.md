Some “vase” designs for 3D printing. That is, they nominally define solid objects but are to be printed with “vase mode” settings which make the interior and top hollow.

Both of them so far happen to be based on polyhedra defined in cylindrical coordinates.

* `trashcrystal.scad` was designed to hold 3D printer waste (filament strings and cleaning wipes), and be decorative besides. It has a narrow neck to discourage fluffy springy things from popping back out the top. For more information see <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2991260>.
* `wavy-hoop.scad` is just a silly flexible bouncy object — if printed without a bottom as well as without a top.
